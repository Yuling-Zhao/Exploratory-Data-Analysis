# Principle 1: Show comparisons
* Always ask a question: compared to what?

# Principle 2: Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure
* What is your causal framework for thinking about a question?

# Principle 3: Show mutilvariate data
* Multivate = more than 2 variables;
* Escape flatland

# Principle 4: Intergration of evidence
* Completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams;
* Data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentationl
* Don't let the tool drive the analysis;

# Principle 5: Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, etc.
* A data graphic should tell a complete story that is credible;

# Principle: Content is king
* Analytical presentation ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relavance and integrity of their content;
